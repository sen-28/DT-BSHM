# DT-BSHM

* Developed a cloud‑based Digital Twin framework to facilitate two‑way mapping between physical structure and its digital replica for real‑time intelligent monitoring.
* Employed MEMS sensors and Narrowband‑IoT protocol to establish long‑term bridge modal analysis with long‑range 4G connectivity at low power consumption.
* Formulated a novel Sensor Placement Algorithm by employing adaptative weight factor updating to resolve multiple standard fitness functions into a single objective optimization
